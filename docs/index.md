## See it in action

I've run it against two popular open-source projects to demonstrate the quality and depth of documentation it generates:

### VueUse Documentation
[View the generated VueUse docs →](https://syntax-scribe.github.io/sample-vueuse/)

[VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) is a collection of essential Vue composition utilities with hundreds of functions. SyntaxScribe automatically analyzed the entire codebase and generated comprehensive documentation showing function signatures, parameters, return types, and relationships between utilities.


### ESLint Documentation
[View the generated ESLint docs →](https://syntax-scribe.github.io/sample-typescript-eslint/ )

The [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a complex monorepo with multiple packages, rule definitions, and intricate TypeScript patterns. SyntaxScribe parsed through the complexity and created clean, navigable documentation that makes the codebase approachable.
